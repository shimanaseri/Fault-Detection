# Midterm Exam Solutions

This collection includes my answers to the Midterm Exam for the Fault Detection course, covering various topics such as fault detection methods, statistical estimation techniques, and machine learning models applied to fault diagnosis.

## Exam Overview

### **Question 1: Least Squares and Widrow-Hoff Update**
This question focuses on the application of least squares and Widrow-Hoff methods:

- **Least Squares Cost Function**: Deriving and optimizing the least squares cost function for fault detection, and applying the Widrow-Hoff update rule for weight and bias adjustments.
- **Gradient Descent and Updates**: Explaining the gradient descent algorithm and the corresponding weight and bias updates.
  
### **Question 2: Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**
This question covers the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for a given dataset:

- **MLE Derivation**: Deriving the MLE for a given probability distribution and solving for the parameters that maximize the likelihood function.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Using the logarithmic transformation to simplify the problem and find the optimal MLE estimate.

### **Question 3: Decision Boundaries and Gaussian Models**
This question involves decision boundaries and classification using Gaussian models:

- **Gaussian Distributions**: Deriving decision surfaces for classification using two Gaussian distributions.
- **Decision Surface Equation**: Solving for the decision boundary and analyzing the decision surface between two classes.

### **Question 4: Loss Matrix and Decision Making**
This question involves constructing a loss matrix for decision-making:

- **Loss Matrix Construction**: Creating a loss matrix and deriving the decision boundary by minimizing the associated risk.
- **Decision Surface Analysis**: Evaluating the performance of the classifier with respect to accuracy, false acceptance rate (FAR), and false rejection rate (MAR).
