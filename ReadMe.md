# Fault Detection Assignments

Welcome to my **Fault Detection ** repository! This project is focused on applying advanced machine learning and statistical methods for fault detection and classification in industrial systems. The project is divided into multiple phases, where the goal is to develop models for detecting faults in system parameters like temperature, pressure, and flow rate.

## Project Overview

### **Project Phases**

1. **Phase 1: Fault Detection and Classification**  
   The first phase focuses on data preprocessing, feature extraction, and basic fault detection techniques. Key tasks include:
   - Data collection and preprocessing using a simulated boiler dataset.
   - Dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE, Autoencoders).
   - Training fault detection models using neural networks and evaluating them based on classification accuracy.

2. **Phase 2: Advanced Fault Detection and Classification**  
   In this phase, the models were refined using advanced techniques:
   - Implementation of advanced neural networks such as CNN, MLP, and Hybrid networks.
   - Application of regularization techniques (Dropout, L2 regularization) to prevent overfitting.
   - Optimizing models using techniques like **ReduceLROnPlateau** and enhancing fault detection performance.

3. **Final Phase: Model Optimization and Transformer Networks**  
   This phase builds on the work from Phase 2 and introduces more sophisticated models:
   - Advanced machine learning models like Transformer networks were applied for fault detection using attention mechanisms.
   - Further optimization of models using data scaling and regularization to improve performance.
   - The evaluation focused on comparing the performance of MLP, CNN, Hybrid networks, and Transformer models with metrics such as AUC, F1 Score, and Precision.

### **Techniques Used**
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA, t-SNE, LDA, Autoencoders for reducing the feature space and enhancing model performance.
- **Machine Learning Models**: MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron), CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), Hybrid networks combining CNN and LSTM, and Transformer models with attention mechanisms.
- **Regularization and Optimization**: Dropout, L2 regularization, and ReduceLROnPlateau for preventing overfitting and improving model convergence.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: AUC, F1 Score, Recall, Precision, Confusion Matrices, ROC Curves to assess model performance.
